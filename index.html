<div>Growing up in both NYC and Woodstock, NY, as well as being the child of two freelance artists from different parts of the world, my upbringing has been pretty unconventional. My parents have always surrounded themselves with the creative type, so i've been constantly exposed to funky people doing unique things. Everything I make is based on something which already exists, and then combined with my perception of that thing or person. But, nothing is actually real, only in our physical state, but thoughts and emotions are real, so that's what I try to convey. Some things like clothing are tangible, and have a process to make it tangible, photos/videos are intangible, so they rely more on interpretation and imagination.</div>
